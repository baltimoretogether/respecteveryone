RespectEveryone
===============

A living anti-harassment policy for the Baltimore Tech community.

These policies are adapted from the Ada Initiative and its example event anti-harassment policy found here: http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/event_anti-harassment/Policy

The working policy is available in four formats:

* __Short Public:__ This is a very short version that refers the reader to a longer version of the policy. Suitable for footers on announcement emails, web pages, news stories, etc.
* __Medium Public:__ This is a statement of the organizers' principles and sets expectations for the tone and style of the event. Suitable for the event web site and longer announcements.
* __Full Public:__ This version focuses on specific instructions to the participants, with the goal of preventing harassment in the first place through education. Suitable for the event web site and event program material.
* __Internal:__ This version is intended for internal use by the event staff. It defines an example enforcement policy that can be tweaked to suit your event organization style.
