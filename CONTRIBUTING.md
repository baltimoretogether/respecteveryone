# Contributing to RespectEveryone anti-harassment policy
Help us make this policy effective and easy to adopt, even if you known nothing about Github.

## Ask a question

You can use "Issues" which work sort of like a living suggestion box or discussion forum. Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/baltimoretogether/respecteveryone/issues) and click "New Issue" to ask a question or make a suggestion.

## Change the policy

If you know your way around github, you can fork the repository and submit a pull request. If you don't, that's fine -- just submit an issue that says "CHANGE" in the title, and include your suggested change. Someone else can submit the change (via pull request) for you.

## Help others submit changes

Watch the issue queue for any issue with "CHANGE" in the title and create a pull request for that change, referencing the original issue # in your pull request.

Thanks for helping make Baltimore tech events a safe place for everyone.
